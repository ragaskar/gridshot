## Why GridShot is different

| Focus | What GridShot does |
| --- | --- |
| Calibrated measurement | Uses a verified ChArUco mat plus camera/lens profiles instead of treating a visually plausible trace as physical truth. |
| Height-aware correction | Separates silhouette-driving height, maximum tool height, and desired recess depth. A calibrated second photo can solve thickness automatically. |
| Local ownership | Runs the web app, segmentation models, projects, and tool library on your own machine. |
| Conservative automation | Calibration, segmentation, pairing, thickness, and generation can pass, request review, or block. Uncertain batch matches remain unmatched. |
| Reproducible geometry | Retains source photos, calibration, accepted outlines, settings, and printer compensation so a bin can be regenerated rather than retraced. |

## How it works

```text
phone photo(s) → calibrated silhouette → reviewed physical outline
                → canonical bin geometry → STL / 3MF / SVG / GLB
```

1. Print and verify the calibration mat.
2. Photograph one tool, or take a calibrated two-view pair to solve thickness.
3. Refine the segmentation in the shared photo editor.
4. Review or edit the reconstructed physical cutout.
5. Generate a bin immediately or save the tool for later composition.

The same accepted outline can produce three bin styles:

| Style | Result |
| --- | --- |
| **Pocket** | A conventional solid bin with a recessed tool cavity. |
| **Stackable corral** | A lighter bin with a thin tool shelf, full-height separator, standard feet, and stacking lip. |
| **Live grid** | The complete corral plus usable Gridfinity sockets wherever a full 42 mm socket safely fits. |

## Quick start

> New to GridShot? [docs/usage](docs/usage/README.md) is a full first-tool
> walkthrough — Hugging Face access, printing and verifying a mat, the empty-mat
> reference photo, camera calibration, and a ChArUco/camera-setup primer — written
> for someone who's never used the app before. See also
> [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) (Docker vs. rootless Podman, SELinux,
> LAN/remote access) and
> [docs/trace-tolerance-slice.md](docs/trace-tolerance-slice.md) (print-checking a
> pocket fit before committing to the full bin).

### Requirements

- Docker with Compose, or rootless Podman in Docker-compatibility mode
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit
- NVIDIA Ampere-generation or newer GPU with at least **8 GB VRAM**
- Tailscale CLI (optional) for the phone-friendly HTTPS endpoint used by `scripts/up`

The 8 GB minimum covers the core SAM 2.1 interactive capture workflow. **12 GB or
more is recommended** when using SAM 3 concept segmentation or RoMa dense matching,
because those optional models load on demand and remain resident alongside the
interactive model. The current container runs inference in BF16; CPU-only and
pre-Ampere GPUs are not supported configurations.

GridShot uses GPU 0 by default. On a multi-GPU host, choose a different NVIDIA CDI
device for the current launch:

```bash
GRIDSHOT_GPU_DEVICE=nvidia.com/gpu=1 scripts/up --no-tailscale
```

#### Podman and other rootless engines

`scripts/up` and `scripts/gridshot` handle this for you — no setup needed. They
use `docker compose` when a `docker` binary exists (including podman-docker's
shim) and `podman compose` otherwise; `GRIDSHOT_COMPOSE` overrides the choice.

Bind mounts carry the `:z` SELinux shared label, which Docker ignores on hosts
without SELinux. The one thing that differs by engine is the container user:
rootless engines map container UID 0 to the host user, so `0:0` is what writes
files you own, while under rootful Docker it would mean real root. The scripts
ask the engine which it is and set `GRIDSHOT_USER` accordingly, warning rather
than guessing quietly when no daemon answers.

Driving compose directly instead? Set it yourself, in `.env` or the environment
(see `.env.example`):

```bash
GRIDSHOT_USER=0:0 podman compose up -d --build segserver web
```

### 1. Create and verify a calibration mat

Ready-to-print calibration mats are included for each supported paper size:

| Paper | Mat ID | Download |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A4 | `a4-7x9-5c8f11` | [PDF](calibration-mats/gridshot-mat-a4-7x9-5c8f11.pdf) |
| A3 | `a3-10x14-030735` | [PDF](calibration-mats/gridshot-mat-a3-10x14-030735.pdf) |
| US Letter | `letter-7x9-7dd4fa` | [PDF](calibration-mats/gridshot-mat-letter-7x9-7dd4fa.pdf) |

Register the selected board in your local GridShot configuration before verifying
it. This also generates the same board in the ignored `mats/` runtime directory:

```bash
scripts/gridshot mat new --paper a4
scripts/gridshot mat verify <mat-id> --measured-x <mm> --measured-y <mm>
```

Replace `a4` with `a3` or `letter` when using another bundled size.

Print the selected mat at **100% / Actual Size**. Measure the marked X and Y spans
with calipers and record both values. An unverified mat cannot be used for capture.

### 2. Start GridShot

```bash
scripts/up
```

For a workstation-only deployment without Tailscale:

```bash
scripts/up --no-tailscale
```

`scripts/up` builds and starts the web and segmentation services, then exposes the
web app through Tailscale:

- `http://localhost:8800` on the workstation
- `https://<host>.<tailnet>.ts.net/` from a tailnet-connected phone

`--no-tailscale` does not invoke the Tailscale CLI or change any existing Tailscale
Serve configuration.

### 3. Capture a tool

Take two photos from different camera positions for automatic thickness recovery,
or use one photo and enter the height at the tool's widest silhouette. The result
screen provides the corrected 1:1 outline, an orbitable 3D preview, and manufacturing
downloads.

## Batch processing and tool library

GridShot accepts a ZIP containing one or two photos per tool. Batch jobs are bounded,
cancellable, resumable, and checkpointed. Before anything enters the library, the
review screen shows proposed pairs, outlines, thickness results, warnings, and
readiness.

- Commit every reviewed tool, or explicitly commit only the ready subset.
- Keep unresolved tools as a draft for correction or recapture.
- Leave ambiguous image pairs unmatched instead of guessing.
- Retry safely without creating duplicate library entries.

Accepted tools become reusable local library records. Each record keeps the original
photo silhouette, corrected physical footprint, vertical measurements, calibration,
printer profile, settings, warnings, and non-destructive outline revisions.

From the library you can regenerate one tool, combine several tools into one bin, or
compose bins across a drawer. Cards, previews, and exports all use the same canonical
derivation path. Each card also has **"Re-open as current"**, which brings that
tool's full capture/calibration details and downloads back as the app's current
tool — useful after scanning something else has moved on from it, since the
current-tool view only ever holds one tool at a time.

## Printer compensation

GridShot can fit cavity compensation for a specific printer, material, nozzle, and
process. Print three independent copies of the long-baseline coupon, then repeat each
measurement option once per copy:

```bash
scripts/gridshot bench coupon --copies 3
scripts/gridshot bench record \
  --printer X1C --material PLA --nozzle-mm 0.4 --process standard \
  --a-x 124.3 --a-x 124.4 --a-x 124.3 \
  --a-y 24.7 --a-y 24.8 --a-y 24.7 \
  --b-x 24.7 --b-x 24.8 --b-x 24.7 \
  --b-y 7.7 --b-y 7.8 --b-y 7.7
scripts/gridshot bench printer-profiles
```

Profiles are immutable revisions. Measurements with borderline uncertainty are kept
for diagnosis but cannot become active; severe disagreement is rejected.

## Operations

GridShot stores capture sessions and generated artifacts in `projects/`. Calibration,
printer profiles, the tool library, and downloaded model caches live in `config/`.
Both directories are created automatically by `scripts/up`; back them up before
moving or upgrading a deployment.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for persistent GPU, model, queue, or Hugging Face token
settings. Use `scripts/prune --dry-run` to preview cleanup of old capture projects.

| Service | Port | GPU | Role |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `web` | `8800` | No | FastAPI, the React SPA, and the public API boundary |
| `segserver` | `8801` internal | Yes | SAM 2.1 interactive segmentation, SAM 3 concept segmentation, and dense matching |

Runtime probes are exposed through the web service:

| Probe | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `/api/health/live` | The web process is alive; performs no dependency work. |
| `/api/health/ready` | Storage and interactive segmentation are ready for capture traffic. |
| `/api/health/capabilities` | Detailed model state, verified mats, and inference-queue usage. |

GPU inference is serialized with two waiting slots by default. Set
`GRIDSHOT_INFERENCE_QUEUE_SIZE` to change the queue capacity. Saturated requests fail
quickly with HTTP `429` and `Retry-After` instead of building an unbounded backlog.

## Product status

Implemented today:

- Verified mat and immutable camera-profile calibration
- Interactive segmentation and non-destructive correction editors
- One-photo and calibrated two-photo capture
- Pocket, stackable-corral, and live-grid geometry
- Resumable batch review and fail-closed library commits
- Persistent tool library, multi-tool composition, and drawer export
- Versioned printer compensation and reproducible artifact provenance

Still gated on real evidence:

- The retained physical G1 accuracy matrix
- Production matcher thresholds selected and validated on a representative GridShot capture corpus
- Published first-print-fit and recapture-rate claims

## Changes in this fork

Features added on top of the original public release, newest last:

- Rootless Podman/SELinux support for the compose stack, alongside Docker
  (see [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md))
- Batch calibration signature triage: reports every photo's mismatch in one pass
  instead of aborting at the first one that disagrees
- `--public-bind` flag for `scripts/up` to expose the web UI on the LAN
- `scripts/up` fails fast when `HF_TOKEN` is missing, instead of surfacing the
  failure later as an inference-time error
- Unhandled server errors return their real error text instead of a bare
  "Internal Server Error"
- Web UI for storing the empty-mat reference photo (previously CLI-only and
  undocumented)
- First-tool walkthrough doc for new users
- Downloadable 1mm trace-tolerance slice (STL/3MF) for single-tool bins,
  multi-tool combined bins, and drawer exports — print a small coupon through
  a tool's cutout to check fit before committing to the full bin (see
  [docs/trace-tolerance-slice.md](docs/trace-tolerance-slice.md))
- "Re-open as current" button on each library card, to bring a previously
  saved tool's full details and downloads back as the app's current tool
